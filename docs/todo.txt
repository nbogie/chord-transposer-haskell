* don't recognise N.C. (no chord) e.g.  D [N.C.]           G      G/F#
* TODO: collect and summarise all chords encountered (e.g. show all guitar chords, or talk about the likely (or confirmed) key and their name and harmonic function within it).
* add structured output (json?) including whether a chord was parsed, what part of it wasn't.  typed first, then json.
* TODO: add support for C- where we only have Cm currently.  Drive with examples.
I think when outputting the chords we have to preserve the notation type, so after transposing "C-", we need to say "D-" not "Dm".
* Note we don't really need min/maj/dim/aug parsed out of a string in order to transpose, though it is definitely helpful in key recognition and harmonic function.
* TODO: different chords have different parse rules.  Consider applying completely different parsers to each chord and then deciding which gives the best result (most completely parsed, perhaps, but avoiding key-contextual).

 * report if any chord line was partially parsed - warns user about likely errors.  this is key to useability - we will ALWAYS have parse errors, even just from human mistakes in the input.
 * parse according to the wikipedia table?
 * detect key. in C majr,  [Am7 ->  vi7, D9 -> II9] (where those are all strings)
 * harvest many example chord sheets, and build list of every chord symbol found
 * power chords? E5
 * reread all of wikipedia article see [[Crdapp:TheoryRefs]]
 * a slash chord may be on an interval not a pitch. Cm/M7 - examples?
 * CM6
 * If all we want to do is transpose and romanize, we only need a dirt-simple parser to pick out root note and bass note.  Chord quality and type of sevents are useful if we're guessing key but I think the user should always be happy entering that.

 DONE

 * support added tone chords (Cadd2, C7add13)
 * chord color rename to chord quality
 * given a key, report chords in roman numeral form.  Start test first.  test set will look like:
 * sus chords replace the third with a 2nd or 4th. sus on its own means sus4, so Asus9 means Asus4 with a 9th.
 * C6, Cm6
 * TODO: escape for html all strings from the input, when generating tagged output.

IGNORED:

 * decorations could be :: [Interval].  (don't need)
