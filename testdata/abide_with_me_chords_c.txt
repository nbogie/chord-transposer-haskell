(verse 1)
C  G       Am   Em   Dm        G   C
Abide with me, fast falls the eventide; 

 C   Dm  C    F  C      G       Am  D  G
The darkness deepens, Lord with me ab-ide. 

  C    E    Am  Em   Dm        A      Dm
When other help-ers fail and comfort flee, 

 G   C  G    C   E   Am  Dm  C   G   C
Help of the helpless, O  ab-ide with me. 


(verse 2)
  C   G       Am   Em    Dm          G     C
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; 

  C      Dm    C   F   C     G      Am  D  G
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass a-way.

 C      E   Am   Em  Dm    A      Dm
Change and decay in  all around I see; 

G   C   G   C   E   Am   Dm  C   G   C
O Thou who changest not, ab-ide with me.
