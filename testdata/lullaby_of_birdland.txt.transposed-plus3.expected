Lullaby of Birdland
Words & Music by George David Weiss & George Shearing
Recorded by Mel Torme, 1963

Gm           Em7-5     A7-9        D7
Lullaby of birdland  - that's what I

Gm7    D#M7  Cm7      F9
Always hear when you sigh;

Dm7          Gm7
Never in my word land

Cm7            D#dim     A#  D#9       Am7-5        D7
Could there be ways to reveal    in a phrase how I feel.

Gm            Em7-5     Am7-9    D7
Have you ever heard two turtle doves

Gm7      D#M7 CM7       F9
Bill and coo when they love?

Dm7                Gm7
That's the kind of magic

Cm7      D#dim          A#  F7           A#    A#/A
Music we make with our lips     when we kiss.

Bridge:
G9            G7-9       Cm      Cm7
And there's a weepy old willow -

F9        D#dim         A#    A#/A
He really knows how to cry!

G9             G7-9      Cm      Cm7
That's how I'd cry on my pillow

F9            D#dim       A#             D7
If you should tell me farewell and good-bye.

Gm        Em7-5       A7-9     D7
Lullaby of birdland - whisper low,

Gm7     D#M7   Cm7       F9
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go

Dm7            Gm7
Flyin' high in birdland,

Cm7         D#dim   A#   D#9     Am7-5            D7
High in the sky up above    all because we're in love.

Repeat Bridge. Repeat last verse. 

Coda:
Cm7        D#dim     A#
High in the sky up above

Cm7     F9  D#dim  A#    D#9   Cm7   B7    A#
All because we're- in - love.
