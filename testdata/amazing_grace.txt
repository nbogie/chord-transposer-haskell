  G	 	 	C	 	G	 	 	 	 	 
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
      Em	 	D	 	D7	 	 	 	 
That saved a wretch like me!
G	 	 	 	C	 	G	 	 	 	 	 
I once was lost, but now am found;
  Em	 	D7	G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Was blind, but now I see.
                       
  G	 	 	 	 	C	G	 	 	 	 
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
      Em	D	 	 	D7	 	 	 	 
And grace my fears relieved;
  G	 	 	C	 	G	 	 	 	 	 
How precious did that grace appear
  Em	D7	G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The hour I first believed.
                       
    G	 	 	C	G	 	 	 	 	 
Through many dangers, toils and snares,
    Em	D	 	D7	 	 	 	 	 	 
I have already come;
  G	 	 	 	C	 	G	 	 	 	 
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
  Em	 	D7	 	G	 	 	 	 	 	 
And grace will lead me home.
                       
  G	 	 	 	 	C	G	 	 	 	 
When we've been there ten thousand years,
      Em	D	 	D7	 	 	 	 	 
Bright shining as the sun,
  G	 	 	 	C	G	 	 	 	 	 
We've no less days to sing God's praise
  Em	 	D	G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Than when we'd first begun.
