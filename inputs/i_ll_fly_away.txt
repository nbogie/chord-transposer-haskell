D
Some bright morning when this life is o'er
G          D
I will fly away
D                            Em
To a home on God's celestial shore
D      A    D
I will fly away


D
I will fly away oh glory
G          D
I will fly away
D                     Em
When I die Hallelujah by and by
D      A    D
I will fly away
