Washing Of The Water (Peter Gabriel)
------------------------------------
Intro:
River, river, carry me on
C

Living river, carry me on
C

River, river, carry me on
F           C

To the place where I come from
Bb/C                      C

Verse:
------
So deep, so wide, will you take me on your back for a ride
C  F/D      C/E            F                          C

If I should fall, would you swallow me deep inside
C  G/B      Am              F               C

River, show me how to float, I feel like I'm sinking down
C      F/D     G/B    C        F                     C

Thought that I    could     get along
Am/C    C    Em/B G/B    F       C

Chorus:
-------
But here      in this water, my feet won't touch the ground
    C	 Am/F         D/F#      Fmaj7/G    Dm/G      C

I need something to turn  myself around
C Am/F D/F#         Fmaj7/G Dm/G  C

Bridge:
-------
Letting go, it's so hard, the way it's hurting now
        Am          C/G                Fmaj7

To get this love untied
   D/F#     E/G#   Am

So tough to stay with this thing, cos if I follow through
            C/G                            Fmaj7

I face what I  denied
  D/F#      E/G# Am

I'll get those hooks out of me
               C/G     

And I'll take out the hooks that I sunk deep in your side
         Fmaj7                     D/F#      E/G#    Am

Kill that fear of emptiness, that loneliness I hide
                  C/G             Fmaj7        C

[verse]
Going away, away toward the sea
River deep, can you lift up and carry me
Oh roll on through the heartland
'Til the sun has left the sky
River, river, carry me high

[chorus]
'Til the washing of the water, make it all alright
Let your waters reach me, like she reached me tonight

[chorus]
River, oh river, river running deep
Bring me something that will let me get to sleep

In the washing of the water will you take it all away
Bring me something to take this pain away
